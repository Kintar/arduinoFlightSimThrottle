# 3d-printed Arduino-based Flight Sim Throttle

This is a work-in-progress USB throttle controller for flight sims.  The STL files can be found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4668648).

To use the throttle, flash an Arduino Leonardo or Micro with the .ino file found in the `arduino` directory, place a magnet and hall effect sensor in the base of the unit so that the sensor is as close as possible to the magnet, attach the sensor's output to the A0 pin on your board, then use this app to calibrate the hall sensor.
